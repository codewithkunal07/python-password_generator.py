## 🔐 Random Password Generator in Python

This Python script generates a secure, random password based on the user-specified length using letters, digits, and punctuation. Great for learning about strings, randomness, and function-based design.

---

### 🧰 Features

- User-defined password length  
- Uses letters (`A-Z, a-z`), numbers (`0-9`), and special characters  
- Randomized output for secure password generation  
- Easy to extend for more features like strength check or exclusion rules

---

### 🚀 How to Run

Run the script using any Python interpreter (Python 3.x recommended):

```bash
python password_generator.py
```

---

### 🎮 Sample Output

```text
Enter the desired length of the password: 7  
Generated Password: Z6lgA}N
```

> Note: Every run produces a different password due to randomness.
